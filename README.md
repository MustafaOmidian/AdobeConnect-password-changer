# adobeConnectPasswordChanger
a python script that can change whole given users password
**Used to change whole university students password**
notice that it worked when whole users password was their student number!
**How to run**
you cant run code and if you run it it doesnt work, Because University server has changed at All!
Just use of Code structure and see how AdobeConnect Send requests as url to commit changes to its Users
**Hope Enjoy**
